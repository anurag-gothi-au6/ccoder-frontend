# About Our Project:

Are you a code newbie?

      Learning to program is exhilarating and challenging... and also frustrating, exhausting, and overwhelming.
      CCoder provides countless small wins. The exercises are achievable mini-quests: small and well-defined, and with enough complexity to uncover bite-sized knowledge gaps.
      CCoder is a place built for anyone to practice and perfect their programming skills. Challenges are added almost every day so you can work on applying your skills
